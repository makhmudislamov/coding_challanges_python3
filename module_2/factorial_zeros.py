Prompt

Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Your solution should be in logarithmic time complexity.

For a hint, try looking at this spreadsheet, to see if you notice a pattern that can help you predict the number of trailing zeros. What happens as n rises? What are the transition points where the number of trailing zeros rises?
