"""
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?


Example 1:
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1

# PSEUDOCODE - brute force
# create an empty array
# iterate over the integers arr
# add each element to empty array
# at the same time check if the element appears more than once in new array.
