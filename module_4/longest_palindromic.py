"""
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

def longest_palindrome(input_string):
    # declare palindromic substring
    # it should start from the first char and should expand

    # iterate over the input:
    # check if the current substring is equal to its reverse
    # return the palindromic substring
